carousel is a carousel jQuery plug-in.
It has customizable animations/effects. You can change animations/effects with plug-in options easily.
Carousel reads all dimension values from CSS and the plug-in's options doesn't have any dimension values.

I developed it to use on my Uygulama project's new version.

I've only tested it on 
  * Chromium (14.0.835.202)
  * Google Chrome (15.0.874.120)
  * Mozilla Firefox (3.6.17)
  * Opera (11.52) 
  * Internet Explorer (8.0.6001)
and it works enough for me for now!
